Assignment 5 Comments:

sklearn:

new dataset. 5/5

random forest 5/5

GridSearchCV 5/5

Scatterplot 5/5

Belief Networks:

alarm queries 5/5

car queries 5/5

additional node 5/5

HMM:

load 5/5

generate 10/10

lander models 5/5

forward 7/10 - mostly working, but final probabilities are wrong:
Forward probabilities:
State #: 0.000000
State happy: 0.000000
State grumpy: 0.000000
State hungry: 0.000000

viterbi 10/15 - getting there, but it crashes.
Traceback (most recent call last):

Utility:

q1 5/5

q2 5/5

q3 1/2 - need to renormalize the probabilities

q4 3/3

q5 2/2

q6 3/3

91/100
